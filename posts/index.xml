      <description>Hello,
Aah so here we are. I think I have finally mustered the courage to start a blog. I had myraid reasons to start a blog, and I have been planning to blog for the past few years, but I guess procrastination always managed to kick in. Voila! Here we are.
While I have taken the first step and commenced this journey, the real obstacle is maintaining consistency. I remember talking to a friend about the difficulties of starting something and investing consistent efforts.</description>
