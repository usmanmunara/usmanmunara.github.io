      <description>Hello,
Aah so here we are, I think I have finally mustered the courage to start a blog. I had multitutdes of reasons to start a blog and I have been planning to start blogging since past few years, but I guess I always ended up hitting dead ends. Alas! here we are.
While, we have taken the first step and started this the question is to maintain consistency. I rememeber talking to a friend about the difficulties of starting something and maintaining consistency.</description>
