      <description>Hi! I am Usman and I am a Computing Mathematics major at the City University of Hong Kong.
While I tinker with different spaces like Tools for Thoughts, my current research interest is in topics in Theoretical Computer Science like Quantum Information Theory and Complexity Theory. The exponential difficulty of having fault-tolerant quantum computers and the thought of possesing these powerful machines in our hands, which can not only solve some of the most complex problems we have but also simulate the universe is just intriguing to me.</description>

      <description>Hello,
Aah so here we are. I think I have finally mustered the courage to start a blog. I had a multitude of reasons to start a blog, and I have been planning to start blogging for the past few years, but I guess I always ended up hitting dead ends. Alas! Here we are.
While I have taken the first step and started this, the question at hand is to maintain consistency.</description>
